# Crop Yield Prediction Tool

This is a streamlit-based tool that predicts crop yields based on historical weather data for a given state and crop type. It helps farmers and crop enthusiasts make informed decisions about planting and resource allocation.

## How It Works

- **Upload Weather Data:** Users upload historical weather data files in NetCDF format containing information on temperature, humidity, precipitation, and more.

- **Select Your State:** Users specify the state where they plan to cultivate the crops. Different regions have different weather patterns, which affect crop yields.

- **Choose Your Crop:** Users select the crop they intend to grow, either corn or soybeans.

- **Prediction Process:** The program processes the data, applies machine learning models, and predicts the expected crop yield based on historical weather patterns.

- **Get Your Prediction:** The predicted crop yield is displayed to the user, providing valuable insights for planning and decision-making.

## Usage

To use this tool, follow the instructions in the program. You can run the program and interact with the user interface to make predictions.
